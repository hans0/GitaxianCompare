# GitaxianCompare
Deck comparison tool for MtG


Only works with either local files and/or direct links to the .txt or .dec files from MtgTop8 and MTGGoldfish


I made this because I hated doing this manually and ending up with 59 or 63-card decks somehow.


To-do list:
- Add support to just take the web addresses
- Add support for TappedOut and DeckStats
- Add 'Save' option
- Add 'Print' option
- Create stand-alone versions (without JRE?) for:
    - Windows
    - macOS
    - Linux
